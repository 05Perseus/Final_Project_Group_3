# Self_Assessment
In our Airflight Project, I was responsible for the database as a whole. 
- I mocked up the database,
- Created the ERD schema,
- Identify primary and foreign keys,
- Make sure machine learning module is
connected to the provisional database,
- I used SQL to create the on_time_reporting table for the 12 months of the year as well as the weather_data table
- I apprend all the 12 months tables because they were all in diferents csv files.
- Then I joined the final on_time_reporting table to the weather data
- This final table was the one we exported to do our machine learning analysis. 

I had a lot of challenge importing the data because the csv data types were not correct so I had the make sure I change the data types. 
I also had to create a few colums like "DATE" to be able to so the join and the "unique_ID" to have a primary key for us to import the data into sql

# Team_Assessment 
Here are summary of the work we have done to get ready for the project
Made a google slides and define who will take care of what sections
- Matthew: Talked about the project presentation, why we've choosen this topic and what question are we trying to answer
- Fatima: I present the database, how i got it into SQL, how I used the CREATE, APPEND and JOIN tables functions
- Travers: will present our machine learning model
- Yunkai: went over about result of the analysis and future analysis , also anything we could have done better

As a team, we made sure 
- our slides are primarily images or graphics
- Our images are cleared
- All team members will present equal proportions
- The dashboard will be presented in real time

# Challenge
- Choose topic took a lot of time
- Time management for milestones 
- Use more tools to visualize the data
- Role assignment unclear


# Summary of the project

Airflight delay could be a very frustrating experience a customer could go through. We, as a group, decided to predict airflight that could help customer better organize their travel plan.
In 2020, As there were 369 million airline passengers that year roughly 37,000,000 passengers experience delays
We will use machine learning algorithms with the flight data, weather data, airport data to predict if a flight will be delayed or not. Let people have some sort of certainty with their travels.
