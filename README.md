# Airline Delay Prediction Model
![image](Resources/plane.gif)
## Overview
- Application run in browser to predict flight delays using machine learning and weather data API.

## Why
- Flight delay can be a waste of money and time. Predicting the probability of a weather delay is exciting and useful.

## Data Set
- We Chose a [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/threnjen/2019-airline-delays-and-cancellations)
- The data set is sourced from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, organized and has a preliminary Machine learning model. 

## Questions We Hope To Answer

- Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis on the data set. 
- Which carriers are most and least reliable for on-time departure? 
- Which airports are best and worst for on-time departures? 
- Which features in the data set are most correlated with a departure delay?
- Use the dataset to make predictions. Can you accurately predict a departure delay?
- Use the raw data files to re-tool the dataset and make our own prediction problem. Can we predict the reason for departure delay? Can we predict arrival delay?

# Team Communication Protocols
## Branches
- Branches should be created using the following format: `<feature>_<initials>` (i.e `machine-learning-model_TL`).
- Each neww feature of the Application should have a resprective branch.
- [Helpful Wiki for creation and management of branches](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches)

## Issues
- Each Application enhancements should have the following creation flow:
  - Create an Issue with the Enhancement Feature as the title (i.e. `Provisional Machine Learning Model`)
  - If the Issue falls within your project duties, assign the Issue to yourself. Otherwise, a team member will assign themselves open Issues that fit their project duties or skill set.  
  - If a new Issues is blocked by another issue, add the number of the Issue in the new Issue comments.  
  - Add the appropriate label to the Issue (i.e. `documentation`, `enhancement` etc.)
  - Here is a [Best Practices Guide to Github Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart)
  - Once you have assigned or been assigned an Issue, this should be communicated to the team in Slack for clarity (an @here may be used in time sensitive communication)

## Slack
- `Threads` should be used when discussing deliverables in general chat, to make it easy for members to follow projects asynchronously.
- `Pin` data sets, links or important post pertaining to the project in the team chat in order to expedite searches. 

## Zoom
- Calendar invites should include Zoom links and entry codes
- Free Zoom has a max time of 40 minutes, then force quits. If meeting time is exceeding, rejoin the meeting using the original link.
- Google free service could also be considered for meetings expected to be longer that 40 min.
